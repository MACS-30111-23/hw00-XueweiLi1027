# About me
![Greeting](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/D4E12AQGNLEWWcftmRg/article-cover_image-shrink_720_1280/0/1678884983288?e=1701302400&v=beta&t=ORpPu28fBsBscqnHpbJ4psqyhYS3VrsCpR-oTB3OsCU)
- I am Xuewei Li, a MPASS(Political Science) student. I would call myself a **professional city hopper** because Chicago is the fourth city I moved into this year. I was lucky to have a chance to explore life in Canberra, Melbourne and Shanghai, each for several months before arriving Chicago. The list was even longer before the Covid-19 pandemic hit the world. Just to name a few:
1. Boston, MA (3 months)
2. Cambridge, UK (3 months)
3. Taiwan (1 month)
- I have gradually accustomed to the *always-on-the-road lifestyle* and enjoy it. Despite years of complaints from my mum for me not being around, she happily launched me to different corners of the world (with her money as fuel) and was always excited when I shared with her the good, the bad, the ugly. **My mum is my favorite person on this planet. I love her unconditionally.**
- If you want to know more about me, take a look at my personal website: https://xueweilifrida.wixsite.com/60615. The website is still under construction. I am open to feedback of any kind ; )

# Reflection on the assignment
I found myeslf familiar with most of the skills that this assignment requires, such as bolding letters and making lists, so overall I complete the homework pretty smoothly. But, I did not know how to insert picture into a markdown file. My solution was that I went to ChatGPT and asked this very question. To my surprise, there is no button in a markdown environment that allows me to manually upload a photo to the file. Instead, the way to insert a photo into a markown file is by writing syntax. I wonder if there is a way to adjust the size of a picture or do certain layout design (e.g. wrapping text around a picture) in a markdown file. Can this also be achieved by writing syntax? If yes, that will be very cool.
